/**
 * Lists use Immutable.List, as do Vectors, but we add
 * an `isVector` key to vectors to tell them apart.
 *
 * Keywords and Symbols (in the Clojure sense) are
 * represented with subtypes of Immutable.Record. There's
 * no central symbol table created during the parse,
 * which means we're using a bit more memory, but it's
 * easier than creating two separate tables for the keywords
 * and the symbols and passing those around everywhere.
 * Plus, it works just to return a "different" Record, since
 * those compare by value thanks to Immutable.js.
 *
 * For numbers, strings, and booleans, we use the corresponding
 * js primitives, and nil becomes null.
 *
 * We represent clojure functions as a class. We can't (yet)
 * have that class extend Function, because support for that
 * is still too buggy in node (it's ES6 @@create voodoo).
 * But soon.
