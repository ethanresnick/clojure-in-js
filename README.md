# clojure-in-js

This project will implement a small-but-workable subset of clojure in JS, probably interpreting the code rather than compiling it.

This project isn't something you'd ever want to use in production, since [Clojurescript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) already exists. Rather, it's a way for me to play around with writing an interpreter.
